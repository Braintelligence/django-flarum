# django-flarum
This repository contains a Django package to integrate Flarum within Django. It is a Work-in-Progress and nowhere done yet. If you want to contribute to this or message me, please visit https://discuss.flarum.org/d/2291-integrating-flarum-within-a-django-project/14 and discuss with us.

This repository for now is tied to https://github.com/Braintelligence/flarum-ext-django but may work standalone.
